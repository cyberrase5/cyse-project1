# Cyber Security Base Project I
Course project for Cyber Security Base with 5 vulnerabilites as per the assignment

### Starting up
- Ã¶as
- las

### User Guide
A simple Twitter/X -style app, where you can leave messages for everyone to see. There are two kinds of users, normal and admin users. Everyone can send messages, but only admins can remove them. I think you can figure out the rest.

Start the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/

No logging out because I'm lazy lol

## The 5 Vulnerabilities
I've chosen the 2017 list https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/Top_10 plus CSRF, as it's allowed in the assignment

### A1:2017-Injection
https://github.com/cyberrase5/cyse-project1/blob/master/chat/views.py#L35 (and the couple of lines below)

Description\
Before creating an account, the server checks whether an account with this name already exists, because Django handles the situation by giving an error page, not very elegant. If an account already exists, the registration page is rendered again with a helpful red error message, including the attempted name (pulled from the database!). The query string is constructed unsafely, which makes the app vulnerable to SQL injections.

Test it yourself\
First, create an account, the details don't matter, just remember the username. Now try to create an account with the same name, and you'll get an error message "Username [({chosen_name},)] already in use". Because the query is unsafe and the entire SQL response is given to the message, finding the correct text to input as username will result in data leaking. You can try to figure it out yourself or check it below:
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  {chosen_name}' UNION SELECT password FROM auth_user --
  
</details>
Now create an account with the malicious "username", and this time you will not only get the username but also the list of all the passwords hashed. While the passwords are hashed, the leak is still pretty bad. 

Fixing it\

The main fix is parameterized queries. Also fetchall() has been changed to fetchone() and in the retrun render command response[0] is used as additional security, so that even if the response contained passwords, only the first one would be leaked. Now test the fixed version. comment the code between the comments BEGIN and END BROKEN VERSION and uncomment the FIXED VERSION one and test the previous injection, it doesn't work.

### A5:2017-Broken Access Control

Description\
The app has admin and regular users with different privileges. Admins have their own page, where they can delete messages and view logs, and this page should be accessed only by admins. Try logging in as admin and regular user, you'll see that regular users don't have the admin page button. However, since the backend doesn't check whether the user is admin or not, you can access the admin view as a regular user if you can find the URL for it. This needs to be fixed.\
(NOTE: I know that you can't delete posts as regular user because it has the decorator, but I left it there because it's needed later)

Test it yourself\
Login as user and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/admin/ As mentioned above, you can't do other admin stuff than view the log (more on that later), but I think you'll get the idea

Fixing it\
Link \
Django has a built-in decorator @staff_member_required, which checks the logged in user's is_staff (bool) field. If you tried to delete a message as normal user in the admin view, it will open the Django admin login page with an error message. If you uncomment the decorator linked above, trying to access the admin panel as regular user will result in the same error and the vulnerability is fixed.

### A7:2017-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description\
Much like in the earlier injection section, you shouldn't trust user input blindly. In this implementation I deliberately let the user send any kind of messages without "sanitizing" the input, which leads to possible problems.

Test it yourself\
Try sending a message ```<script>alert("Distressing message");</script>```, and everyone reading the main page will get an annoying popup. If you want to try something more daring, log in as regular user, send a couple of messages normally, then send a message like this: ```<img src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/delete/{message_id}">``` the message is sent, but nothing happens, as delete/ route is protected by the aforementioned decorator. But now log in as admin user and refresh the page, you'll see that the message which id you sent the "image" has disappeared. 

Fixing it\
https://github.com/cyberrase5/cyse-project1/blob/master/chat/templates/pages/index.html#L19 \
Just remove the |safe part, fixed version on the line above commented. Now the app will sanitize the input, leaving only the raw text without the effects they earlier had.

### A10:2017-Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Description\
Apps with logins connected to internet will inevitably face all sorts of low-end attacks, such as bruteforcing passwords. Therefore it's important to keep logs of (attempted) logins and other important events for possible later examination. If certain IP-ranges are responsible for bruteforce attacks, the range can be banned from accessing the sites or logging actual logins might be useful if some foul play suspected.

I'm too afraid (and lazy) to overwrite the default Django login, so I decieded to log registrations. It's not exactly the same thing, but if you look at the code I'm sure you'll understand how my implementation is pretty much the same thing as logging logins.

Test it yourself\

Uncomment log_register(), register an account and check the automatically created file log.txt

Fixing it\
See above

### CSRF

Description\
asd

Fixing it\
Remove the @csrf_exempt decorators and uncomment the {% csrf_token %} in .html files

### Honorable Mentions
- SECRET_KEY in mysite/settings.py is hardcoded; everyone can see it. .env file where the secret key is defined should be created, and in settings.py the hardcoded key should be replaced with something like os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
